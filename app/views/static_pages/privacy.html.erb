  <h4>Use of Cookies</h4>

  <p>
    The Ternstyl website may use "cookies" to help you personalize
    your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed
    on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used
    to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies
    are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web
    server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

    One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a
    convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a

    pages, or register with Ternstyl site or services, a cookie
    helps Ternstyl to recall your specific information on subsequent
    visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
    information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
    and so on. When you return to the same Ternstyl website, the
    information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
    easily use the Ternstyl features that you customized.
  </p>

  <p>
    You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web
    browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually
    modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
    If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully
    experience the interactive features of the Ternstyl services or
    websites you visit.
